# Guess-the-Number-Game
## Introduction
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game! I created this simple yet fun project to test my basic C knowledge. I learned a lot while working on this project. The game offers both a single-player mode and a multiplayer mode (currently under development). In single-player mode, you have 5 chances to guess the number correctly or face defeat!
